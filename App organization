SwiftUI -> Define the entry and top-level structure of your app. 

Describe your app's structure declaratively, much like you declare a view's apperance. Create a type that conforms to the "App" protocol and use it to enumerate the "Scenes" that represent
aspect of your app's user interface. 

SwiftUI enables you to write code that works across all of Apple’s platforms. However,
it also enables you to tailor your app to the specific capabilities of each platform. For example, 
if you need to respond to the callbacks that the system traditionally makes on a UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit app’s delegate, 
define a delegate object and instantiate it in your app structure using an appropriate delegate adaptor property wrapper, 
like UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor.

Scenes:
Declare the user interface grouping that make up the parts of your app. 
A "scene" is part of app's user interface that is managed by the system, meaning that everything defined inside it will be 
displayed in a way that may vary from platform to platform. The reason is that different Apple platforms have other input methods, screen sizes
and hardware characteristics. 
For example, a list shown as one column on an iPhone may be shown as two columns on an iPad. The system will always decide 
the best way to show the user interface. 
A scene is a container that can hold multiple elements such as windows or views.     
System will decide way it displayed based on the platform. Operating system and device the app is plublished will determine the UI interface.

Views:
Complex elments displayed onscreens.
Text, TextFields, Images, Shapes 
Views have properties. 
Distribution of views - horizontal, vertical and grid.
Views are reusable. 

A scene is a view(typically contained by a view controller)that is part of specific sequence. A view is where elements are displayed. 

Windows:
Display user interface content in a window or a collection of windows.

WindowGroup: 
Is a scene that presents a group of identically structured windows.  

Modal Presentation:
Present content in a separate view that offers focused interaction.

App Extension:
Extend your app’s basic functionality to other parts of the system, like by adding a Widget.

Search:
Enable people to search for text or other content within your app.

ContentView: ContentView will be always be the first view shown when the app launches. 

PreviewProvider:  Has no role in the application itself and will not compiled or included in the final code. 
It is there to help you see how the interface will look when the app runs. You can even remove these lines if you don't want Xcode 
to display a live preview.

Main components: main, struct, body, WindowGroup, Scene, ContentView 

In terms of organization, an app structure corresponds to the content behaviour of an application and a SwiftUI application 
contains only one main app structure. 

import SwiftUI

@main 
struct MyNewProject: App {
 var body: some Scene {
  WindowGroup {
   ContentView()
  }
 }
}


import SwiftUI 
struct ContentView: View {
 var body: some View {
  VStack {
   Image(systemName: "globe")
    .imageScale(.large)
    .foregroundColor(.accentColor)

    Text("Hello World!")
  }
   .paddding()
  }
}

File creates a main structure called "MyNewProject" - inside this structure, we have a variable called "body" that represents the scene. 
The following lines add a view called "ContentView" to the "WindowGroup"
