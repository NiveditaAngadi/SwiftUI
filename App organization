SwiftUI -> Define the entry and top-level structure of your app. 

Describe your app's structure declaratively, much like you declare a view's apperance. Create a type that conforms to the "App" protocol and use it to enumerate the "Scenes" that represent
aspect of your app's user interface. 

SwiftUI enables you to write code that works across all of Apple’s platforms. However,
it also enables you to tailor your app to the specific capabilities of each platform. For example, 
if you need to respond to the callbacks that the system traditionally makes on a UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit app’s delegate, 
define a delegate object and instantiate it in your app structure using an appropriate delegate adaptor property wrapper, like UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor.

Scenes:
Declare the user interface grouping that make up the parts of your app. 

Windows:
Display user interface content in a window or a collection of windows. 

Modal Presentation:
Present content in a separate view that offers focused interaction.

App Extension:
Extend your app’s basic functionality to other parts of the system, like by adding a Widget.

Search:
Enable people to search for text or other content within your app.
