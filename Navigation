Advanced SwiftUI concepts.

Navigation should be 
1. Quick
2. Logical 
3. Simple
4. Straightforward



Explore different types of navigation and how to use navigation in the apps. 

Flat and Hierarchical Navigation

1. Flat Navigation
Flat Navigation is where all the views user can possibly navigate to derive from the one there on. 
For example, Consider a web browser where you have multiple tabs opened with different pages on each tab. 

The App contains tab controller, which may have two or more tasbs, where user can easily navigate between tabs. 

struct ContentView: View {
 var body: some View {
  TabView {
     Text("Make reservations")
      .tabItem({ 
         Label("Reservation", systemImage: "note.text")
      })
     Text("Contact Us")
        .tabItem({
         Label("Contact", systemImage: "phone")
        })
   }
 }
}

What is TabView?
A TabView is a view that switches between multiple child views using interactive user interface elements. 


2. Hierarchical Navigation
Only displays one view that contains multiple options for navigation. Where the user can navigate through pages forwards and backwards as desired. 

In app, you need "NavigationView" to create a hierarchical navigation. 

struct ContentView: View {
 var body: some View {
   NavigationView { 
    NavigationLink(destination: EmptyView()) {
      Text("Go to Little Lemon reservation page")
        .font(.title)
    }
      .navigationTitle("Reservation")
   }
 }

}
