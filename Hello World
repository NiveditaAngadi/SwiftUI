When you create a new project (app), In Xcode you will see 3 main sections. 
1. Navigator (left most)
2. Editor 
3. Preview

Swift and SwiftUI are designed to read like natural language. 

Swift -> is the programming language you use to write your app's code 
SwiftUI -> is a framework that provides views, controls, and layout structures for creating your app's interface. 

1. What is App Structure?
App structure defines the content and behaviour of an app. 
SwiftUI app has one and only one main app structure. 

2. Why import SwiftUI?
To access the symbols and features of SwiftUI, the app uses an import declaration to import the SwiftUI framework.

3. What is @main? 
@main attribute to indicate the entry point of the SwiftUI app. 
The entry point is responsible for the start of the app. 

A SwiftUI app contains one and only one entry point. Attempting to apply @main to more than one structure in the app results in a compiler error.

import SwiftUI 
@main 
struct MyApp: App {
   var body: some Scene {
     WindowGroup {
         ContentView()
      }
    } 
 } 

My App structure confirms to the "App" protocol, and provides the content of the app and its behaviour. 

4. What is App protocol?
A type that represents the structure and behaviour of an app. 

You can create an app by declaring a structure that conforms to the App protocol. Implement the required "body" computed property to define the app's content. 

The protocol provides the default implementation of main() method, that system calls to launch your app. 
You can have exactly one entry point among all of your app's files. 

Compose the app's body from instances that conform to the "Scene" protocol. Each scene contains the root view of a view hierarchy and has a life cycle managed by the system.
SwiftUI provides some concrete scene types to handle common scenarios, like for displaying documents or settings. 
You can also create custom scenes. 

5. What is body property?
 "body" is the required computed property defined in the App protocol, which is the requirement of the "App" protocol. 

This property returns the contents of the app described as "scene". 

6. What is "Scene"?
A scene contains the view hierarchy that defines the app's user interface.
SwiftUI provides differnt types of scenes including "WindowGroup", "Window", "DocumentationGroup", & "Settings".
