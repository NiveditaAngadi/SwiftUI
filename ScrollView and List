ScrollViews and Lists are features that allow you to display scrolled lists of elements like list of restaurants. 
Which let you display static data hard coded to the code and dynamic data from arrays or databases.

List and ScrollView are similar elements because they both display elements in rows or columns, one after the other. 
Are both containers that present rows that present rows of data arranged in a single column or line, optionally providing the ability to select one or more 
members. 
A List enables vertical scrolling and a ScrollView enables both horizontal and vertical scrolling. 
List displays elements in vertical direction. 

List displays data with default formatting. 
ScrollView displays data without much formatting. 

ScrollView 
struct ScrollList: View {
    let desserts = ["Apple Pie", "Cheesecake", "Donut", "Ice Cream", "Lemonade"]
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            ForEach(desserts,
                    id: \.self) { dessert in
                Text(dessert)
                    .font(.largeTitle)
            }
        }
    }
}

ForEach command is - SwiftUI loop command, that can be used inside the ScrollView or Lists, for reading elements in arrays or databases and displaying them in sequence. 
Referencing initializer init(_:content:) on ForEach requires that String conforms to "Identifiable" protocol.
"Identifiable" is a protocol that makes objects displayed in a List or ScrollView uniquely identifiable, by forcing them to have an identification field called id.

You can create a tappable elements inside List by "NavigationLinks"
